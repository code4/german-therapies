# German Therapies Website

This is a full-stack web application for German Therapies, a medical practice offering advanced anti-aging and regenerative medicine treatments. The application serves as a comprehensive marketing and patient engagement platform for Dr. Shams Scheik's clinic, featuring detailed service information, doctor credentials, and a contact form for consultation requests.

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with React frontend, Express backend, PostgreSQL database, and comprehensive UI components. It's designed to provide an elegant, professional presentation of medical services while capturing and managing patient inquiries.

**Developed with Claude Code** - AI-powered development environment for rapid, professional web application development.
